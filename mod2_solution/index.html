                In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start
                from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance
                to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically
                based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful
                on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least,
                we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of
                the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that
                utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.
